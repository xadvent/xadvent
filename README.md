Hi, I'm Pierce! I have a Bachelor of Business Administration with a double major in Data Analytics and Marketing, but my real passion is software development.
- I'm currently learning React with the ultimate aim of being able to re-create any social media app from scratch.
- I am also looking for any work opportunities to grow, develop, and prove my skills.
